    "# Conditional Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Like every other programming language, Python also has some predefined conditional statements. A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program. These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has 3 key Conditional Statements that you should know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if statement\n",
    "- if-else statement\n",
    "- if-elif-else statement\n",
    "\n",
    "__if Statement:__\n",
    "The if statement is a conditional statement in python, that is used to determine whether a block of code will be executed or not. Meaning if the program finds the condition defined in the if statement to be true, it will go ahead and execute the code block inside the if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "__if-else Statement:__\n",
    "As discussed above, the if statement executes the code block when the condition is true. Similarly, the else statement works in conjuncture with the if statement to execute a code block when the defined if condition is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "__if-elif-else ladder:__\n",
    "The elif statement is used to check for multiple conditions and execute the code block within if any of the conditions evaluate to be true.\n",
    "The elif statement is similar to the else statement in the context that it is optional but unlike the else statement, there can be multiple elif statements in a code block following an if statement."
